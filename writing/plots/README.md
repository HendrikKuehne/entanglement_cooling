* `betatest`: The cooling step for different temperatures $\beta$; we see that the cooling rate and indeed the complete distentangling procedure does not depend on $\beta$.
* `level_spacing`: The statistics of the consecutive Schmidt coefficient spacings, divided in the main parts and the tails of the distributions. The distributions of states that can be disentangled follow the Gaussian Orthonormal Ensemble, whole states that cannot be disentangled follow Poisson-like distributions.
* `maxheat`: The maximmum entanglement that is achieved during the heating step (where the maximum is taken over the bipartitions of the system). The dashed lines correspond to the theoretical maximum value $\max_{N_A}S=\log_2d = N/2$. The entanglement heating step does not reach this value; why is that?
* `therm`: The complete thermalization process (heating and cooling step).
* `therm_speed`: Cooling steps for different gate sets. We see that the cooling rates are very similar, yet disentangling begins later for larger systems.
