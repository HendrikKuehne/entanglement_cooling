# Open questions

* Take a look at the plots generated by `plot_max_heat`: It seems like the states do not reach maximum entanglement entropy with the heating procedure I used. The maximum value of $S$ is, of course, $\max S=\log_2d$, where $d$ is the dimension of the respective Hilbert space. For multiple qubits and a bipartition $2^N\mapsto 2^{N_A}\otimes 2^{N-N_A}$, I would expect the largest entropy to belong to a splitting of the system in two equal halves, meaning $N_A=N/2$ and thus $\max S = \log_22^{N_A}=N/2$. These are the horizontal lines in the plots of `plot_max_heat`, but the states do not reach this value of entanglement. Why is that?
* Closer investigation of the rates at which entanglement is created and destroyed during heating and cooling, respectively. Apparently $\text{iSWAP}$ generates entabglement slightly slower during heating (see plots)? The curves of mean entanglement entropy generated duing cooling match in shape, disentanglement begins later for larger systems, however - this is particularly strange to me.
